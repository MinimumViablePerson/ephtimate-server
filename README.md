# Ephtimate Server

Server for the Ephtimate app, using [Node.js][1], [Redux][2] and [Socket.io][3].

## What is Ephtimate?

Ephtimate is a small web application that will hopefully make your task estimation a little easier by allowing any member to give their estimation using any kind of device, be it a mobile, a laptop, or a tablet.

## How to run it locally

You will need to have Node.js installed. If you don't already, find out how [here][1].

Once that is done, [clone this repository][4], head to its folder and run `npm install`, followed by `npm start`.

Last but not least, the server by itself won't do much without the [**Ephtimate client**][5], so go get that too!
